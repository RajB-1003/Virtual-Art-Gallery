titile : Virtual Art Gallery

Project Description : 

The Virtual Art Gallery is a full-stack web application that provides an immersive and highly interactive platform for users to explore, curate, and manage digital art collections online. 
Artists can now manage portfolios with real-time statistics, categorize their artworks using metadata and tags, and users can create multiple personalized galleries. This application 
will demonstrate CRUD operations, search/filter/sort functionality, and proper error handling using SQLite, FastAPI, and Next.js.

Database Design (SQLite)
Table 1: Artists 
CREATE TABLE artists (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    country VARCHAR(50),
    bio TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
Table 2: Galleries (Add artist_id for ownership)
CREATE TABLE galleries (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    name VARCHAR(150) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    theme VARCHAR(50),
    artist_id INTEGER, -- Gallery created by an artist (optional)
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (artist_id) REFERENCES artists(id) ON DELETE SET NULL
);
Table 3: Artworks (Add gallery_id reference)
CREATE TABLE artworks (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    title VARCHAR(200) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    artist_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    category VARCHAR(50) CHECK(category IN ('Painting', 'Digital', 'Sculpture', 'Photography', 'Mixed Media')),
    price DECIMAL(10, 2),
    tags TEXT,
    image_url VARCHAR(500),
    created_year INTEGER,
    gallery_id INTEGER, -- Which gallery this artwork is displayed in
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (artist_id) REFERENCES artists(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    FOREIGN KEY (gallery_id) REFERENCES galleries(id) ON DELETE SET NULL
);

Relationship Explanation:
1. Artist ↔ Artworks
•	One-to-Many: One artist can create many artworks
•	Foreign key: artworks.artist_id references artists.id
2. Artist ↔ Galleries (Optional)
•	One-to-Many: One artist can create many galleries (if you want galleries to have owners)
•	Foreign key: galleries.artist_id references artists.id
3. Gallery ↔ Artworks
•	One-to-Many: One gallery can display many artworks
•	Foreign key: artworks.gallery_id references galleries.id
•	An artwork can only be in ONE gallery at a time (simpler for beginners)
